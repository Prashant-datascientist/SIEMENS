## Bounding Box Merging using Data Science Algorithms &amp; Sentiment Analysis Web App

### Bounding Box Merging using Data Science Algorithms:
This project focuses on merging bounding boxes in image data using data science techniques. Bounding boxes are commonly used to identify and localize objects within images. The goal is to develop an efficient algorithm that can merge overlapping or adjacent bounding boxes, resulting in a more accurate representation of the objects present in the image. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of merging algorithms. The final output is a set of merged bounding boxes that can be used for further analysis or object detection tasks.
### Sentiment Analysis Web App:
The Sentiment Analysis Web App is a user-friendly interface that allows users to input text (such as reviews, comments, or social media posts) and receive sentiment predictions. The web app leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of the provided text. It uses pre-trained models or custom-trained models to classify the text as positive, negative, or neutral. The web app provides an intuitive interface, real-time predictions, and visualizations to help users understand the sentiment behind the text they input.
